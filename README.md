# CAR Make-Model Recognition System

A deep learning model developed to recognize the make and model of various cars using the Stanford Cars dataset.

## Overview

This project aims to create a system that can accurately identify the make and model of cars from images. By leveraging a deep learning approach, the model is trained on a diverse set of car images to recognize and classify different car makes and models.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition.
- **Stanford Cars Dataset**: Trained on a comprehensive dataset containing images of cars from different manufacturers and models.
- **Accuracy**: Designed to achieve high accuracy in predicting car makes and models from images.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the Stanford Cars dataset, which includes 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The images are preprocessed to fit the input requirements of the neural network.
2. **Model Training**: The CNN model is trained on the preprocessed images.
3. **Prediction**: The trained model can be used to predict the make and model of a car from new images.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to ensure robust feature extraction and classification.

## Results

The trained model is evaluated on the test set, and the performance metrics are used to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities. The results indicate a high level of accuracy in recognizing various car makes and models.
